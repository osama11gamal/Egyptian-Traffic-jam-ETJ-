# 🚦 Egyptian Traffic Jam (ETJ)

A data analysis project focused on traffic congestion in Egypt.

## Project Idea

Egyptian Traffic Jam (ETJ) analyzes traffic congestion patterns across Egypt to uncover the key factors behind delays and accidents. The project leverages data-driven insights to propose smart solutions that improve traffic flow, enhance road safety, and support more efficient transportation planning.

The project includes:

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**  
  Handling missing values, fixing inconsistencies, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
  Studying congestion behavior, speed trends, accident distributions, and regional variations.

- **Data Visualization and Dashboards**  
  Creating clear visual dashboards that illustrate congestion levels, hotspots, time trends, and accident statistics.

- **Insights and Recommendations**  
  Identifying peak hours, risk factors, anomalies, and providing evidence-based suggestions for improving traffic conditions.

This project aims to turn raw traffic data into meaningful insights and visual representations that support better understanding of Egypt’s traffic challenges and help guide more effective planning and decision-making.
